# Release Workflow

* We need the [`github_changelog_generator`](https://github.com/github-changelog-generator/github-changelog-generator)
* Make a new tag with `l3build tag <vX.Y>`
  * Make sure that all files (sty, doc, ...) are updated with the version, tag, and date
* Run `l3build ctan` to create the `fancyqr-ctan.zip`
* Upload the created `fancyqr-ctan.zip`
